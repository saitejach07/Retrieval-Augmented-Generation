# AI RAG Workbench

AI RAG Workbench is a full-stack Retrieval-Augmented Generation application for uploading documents, indexing them into Chroma Cloud, and asking grounded questions over the uploaded knowledge base.

The project is built as a learning-focused but production-oriented RAG system with hybrid retrieval, query rewriting, RRF fusion, semantic reranking, and source-grounded answer generation.

## Features

- Upload PDF, TXT, and Markdown files
- Parse uploaded files directly from RAM without persisting originals locally
- Chunk documents for retrieval
- Generate embeddings with OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small`
- Store chunk text, metadata, and vectors in Chroma Cloud
- Use cosine similarity for vector search
- Rewrite follow-up questions into standalone retrieval queries
- Retrieve with MMR vector search and BM25 keyword search
- Fuse retrieval results with Reciprocal Rank Fusion
- Rerank candidate chunks with a semantic reranker
- Generate answers with source citations
- Delete indexed documents by exact filename
- React frontend for upload, chat, rewritten query, and source inspection

## Environment Variables

Create `backend/.env` and configure:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
OPENAI_CHAT_MODEL=gpt-4.1-mini
OPENAI_EMBEDDING_MODEL=text-embedding-3-small
CHUNK_SIZE=900
CHUNK_OVERLAP=150
RETRIEVAL_K=5
RETRIEVAL_FETCH_K=20
CHROMA_TENANT=your_chroma_tenant
CHROMA_DATABASE=My_Chroma_Db
CHROMA_API_KEY=your_chroma_api_key
```

Do not commit `backend/.env` to GitHub.

## Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Backend API docs:

```

## Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Frontend URL:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:5173
```

If npm has cache permission issues, use:

```bash
npm install --cache ./.npm-cache
```

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/health` | Health check |
| POST | `/api/documents/upload` | Upload and index documents |
| GET | `/api/documents` | List indexed documents |
| DELETE | `/api/documents/{filename}` | Delete indexed chunks by exact filename |
| POST | `/api/chat` | Ask a question over indexed documents |

## Notes

- Uploaded originals are processed from RAM and are not persisted locally.
- Chunks, embeddings, and metadata are persisted in Chroma Cloud.
- Vector search uses cosine similarity.
- BM25 uses stored chunk text, not vectors.
- RRF is used because BM25 scores and vector similarity scores are not directly comparable.
- Deleting a document is based on the exact filename stored in Chroma metadata.
- Session-based document isolation is planned but not yet implemented.
