## Current Project Folder

```text
/Users/saitejachatarajupalli/Downloads/Coding/AI_RAG
```

Current backend folder:

```text
/Users/saitejachatarajupalli/Downloads/Coding/AI_RAG/backend
```

## Files Created So Far

```text
backend/
  app/
    main.py
    config.py
    schemas.py
    rag/
      chains.py
      ingest.py
      keyword_store.py
      query_processing.py
      rerank.py
      retrieval.py
      vector_store.py
  .env
```

If `backend/app/rag/__init__.py` does not exist yet, create it as an empty file so Python treats `rag` as a package.

## Step 1: Basic FastAPI App

File:

```text
backend/app/main.py
```

Purpose:

- Create the FastAPI app object.
- Add a simple health check endpoint.
- Confirm the backend server can run.

Core code:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI(title="AI RAG Backend")


@app.get("/api/health")
def health():
    return {"status": "ok"}
```

Command to run backend:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Health check URL:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/health
```

Expected response:

```json
{"status":"ok"}
```

## Step 2: Configuration With `.env`

File:

```text
backend/app/config.py
```

Purpose:

- Load configuration from `.env`.
- Avoid hardcoding API keys and model names in code.
- Load Chroma Cloud credentials.
- Keep runtime settings such as chunk size and retrieval count in one place.

Important concept:

```python
BACKEND_DIR = Path(__file__).resolve().parents[1]
```

`__file__` means the current Python file path. We use it to find the backend directory reliably.

Settings included:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `OPENAI_CHAT_MODEL`
- `OPENAI_EMBEDDING_MODEL`
- `CHUNK_SIZE`
- `CHUNK_OVERLAP`
- `RETRIEVAL_K`
- `RETRIEVAL_FETCH_K`
- `collection_name`
- `CHROMA_TENANT`
- `CHROMA_DATABASE`
- `CHROMA_API_KEY`

Removed after the latest architecture change:

- `upload_dir`: no longer needed because uploads are parsed from RAM.
- `chroma_dir`: no longer needed because vectors are stored in Chroma Cloud.

Environment file:

```text
backend/.env
```

Current `.env` values:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
OPENAI_CHAT_MODEL=gpt-4.1-mini
OPENAI_EMBEDDING_MODEL=text-embedding-3-small
CHUNK_SIZE=900
CHUNK_OVERLAP=150
RETRIEVAL_K=5
RETRIEVAL_FETCH_K=20
CHROMA_TENANT=your_chroma_tenant
CHROMA_DATABASE=My_Chroma_Db
CHROMA_API_KEY=your_chroma_cloud_api_key
```

Do not expose the real API keys.

Config test command:

```bash
python -c "from app.config import get_settings; s=get_settings(); print(s.openai_chat_model); print(s.chroma_database)"
```

Expected output includes:

```text
gpt-4.1-mini
My_Chroma_Db
```

`get_settings()` should no longer create `settings.upload_dir` or `settings.chroma_dir`. If it still does, the backend will fail with an `AttributeError`.

## Step 3: API Schemas

File:

```text
backend/app/schemas.py
```

Purpose:

Schemas define the data contract between frontend and backend.

They answer:

- What should the frontend send?
- What should the backend return?
- Which fields are required?
- What type should each field be?

Schemas created:

```text
ChatTurn        one user/assistant chat message
ChatRequest     question + chat history
IntentResult    output from intent detection
SourceChunk     retrieved document chunk shown as source
ChatResponse    final answer + rewritten query + sources
UploadResult    upload/indexing result for one document
UploadResponse  upload/indexing result for multiple documents
DocumentInfo    indexed document info
```

Schema test command:

```bash
python -c "from app.schemas import ChatRequest; print(ChatRequest(question='What is RAG?'))"
```

Expected output:

```text
question='What is RAG?' history=[]
```

## Step 4: Query Processing

File:

```text
backend/app/rag/query_processing.py
```

Purpose:

This file handles the first part of the advanced RAG pipeline:

```text
User Question
  ↓
Intent Detection
  ↓
Conversation Summary
  ↓
Relevant Earlier Conversation
  ↓
Recent Messages
  ↓
Query Rewriting
```

Functions created:

```text
process_query()              main entry point for query processing
detect_intent()              classifies the question and decides if retrieval is needed
summarize_conversation()     creates long-term conversation context
retrieve_relevant_history()  finds relevant older chat turns with keyword overlap
rewrite_query()              rewrites latest question into a standalone retrieval query
_normalize_terms()           helper for keyword matching
_get_llm()                   creates LangChain ChatOpenAI instance
```

Current query rewriting uses three context sources:

```text
1. Conversation summary
2. Recent messages
3. Relevant older messages
```

This is better than only using `history[-8:]`, because it can understand long conversations and references to older topics.

Current relevant-history retrieval is simple keyword overlap. Later we will upgrade it to semantic conversation memory using embeddings and ChromaDB.

Import test command:

```bash
python -c "from app.rag.query_processing import process_query; print('query processing ok')"
```

Expected output:

```text
query processing ok
```

Do not call `process_query()` yet unless a real OpenAI API key is configured.

## Step 5: Vector Store And Chroma Cloud

File:

```text
backend/app/rag/vector_store.py
```

Purpose:

- Create the OpenAI embedding model.
- Connect LangChain to Chroma Cloud.
- Use the existing `rag_documents` collection in `My_Chroma_Db`.

Important function:

```python
get_vector_store(settings)
```

Current implementation uses:

```python
client = chromadb.CloudClient(
    tenant=settings.chroma_tenant,
    database=settings.chroma_database,
    api_key=settings.chroma_api_key,
)

return Chroma(
    client=client,
    collection_name=settings.collection_name,
    embedding_function=get_embeddings(settings),
)
```

This creates the flow:

```text
Our Python code
  ↓
LangChain Chroma wrapper
  ↓
Chroma Cloud
  ↓
rag_documents collection
```

Important point:

```text
LangChain is not ChromaDB.
LangChain helps us talk to Chroma Cloud.
Chroma Cloud is the actual vector database.
```

The old local Chroma settings are no longer used:

```text
persist_directory=settings.chroma_dir
collection_metadata={"hnsw:space": "cosine"}
```

Cosine similarity is configured directly on the Chroma Cloud collection. The Cloud configuration has been verified with `space = cosine`.

The app still supplies its own embedding function:

```python
embedding_function=get_embeddings(settings)
```

So even if Chroma Cloud displays `DefaultEmbeddingFunction` during inspection, this application uses:

```text
OpenAI text-embedding-3-small
1536-dimensional vectors
```

## Step 6: Document Ingestion From RAM

File:

```text
backend/app/rag/ingest.py
```

Purpose:

This file handles the upload-to-Chroma-Cloud pipeline without persisting uploaded originals locally.

Old flow:

```text
UploadFile
  ↓
write to data/uploads/
  ↓
PyPDFLoader(path)
  ↓
chunk → embed → Chroma Cloud
```

Current flow:

```text
UploadFile
  ↓
await file.read()
  ↓
file_bytes in RAM
  ↓
_load_documents(file_bytes)
  ↓
PDF → pypdf PdfReader(BytesIO)
TXT/MD → decode UTF-8
  ↓
LangChain Documents
  ↓
_split_documents()
  ↓
Chunks
  ↓
Add metadata
  ↓
get_vector_store()
  ↓
vector_store.add_documents(chunks)
  ↓
OpenAI text-embedding-3-small
  ↓
1536-dimensional vectors
  ↓
Chroma Cloud / rag_documents
```

Function duties:

```text
ingest_upload()
  Main function. Reads the uploaded file into RAM, loads text, chunks it, and stores chunks in Chroma Cloud.

list_indexed_documents()
  Reads Chroma Cloud metadata and returns the list of indexed documents.

_load_documents()
  Loads text from PDF, TXT, or MD file bytes. PDF uses PdfReader(BytesIO(file_bytes)); TXT/MD uses UTF-8 decode. Also adds metadata like source_id, filename, and page.

_split_documents()
  Splits loaded document text into smaller chunks using chunk_size and chunk_overlap from Settings.
```

Important line:

```python
vector_store.add_documents(chunks)
```

At this point, LangChain uses the embedding model from `vector_store.py` to create vectors for every chunk and store them in Chroma Cloud.

RAM is temporary processing memory only. It is not session storage. After text extraction and indexing, the uploaded file bytes can be discarded. Persistent RAG data lives in Chroma Cloud as chunk text, embeddings, and metadata.

## LangChain Document To ChromaDB Storage

LangChain owns the `Document` format. We did not design this shape:

```python
Document(
    page_content="RAG retrieves relevant chunks...",
    metadata={
        "source_id": "abc123",
        "filename": "rag_notes.pdf",
        "page": 0,
        "chunk_index": 3,
    },
)
```

We control the metadata we attach:

```python
for doc in docs:
    doc.metadata.update(
        {
            "source_id": source_id,
            "filename": filename,
            "page": doc.metadata.get("page"),
        }
    )
```

After chunking, we add:

```python
for index, chunk in enumerate(chunks):
    chunk.metadata["chunk_index"] = index
```

When we call:

```python
vector_store.add_documents(chunks)
```

LangChain + Chroma Cloud internally stores:

```text
documents   -> chunk.page_content
metadatas   -> chunk.metadata
embeddings  -> vector generated from chunk.page_content
```

Conceptually:

```json
{
  "documents": [
    "RAG retrieves relevant chunks before answering..."
  ],
  "embeddings": [
    [0.12, -0.03, 0.44]
  ],
    "metadatas": [
    {
      "source_id": "abc123",
      "filename": "rag_notes.pdf",
      "page": 0,
      "chunk_index": 3
    }
  ]
}
```

## Step 7: SourceChunk Adapter

File:

```text
backend/app/rag/retrieval.py
```

Function:

```python
_source_from_document()
```

Purpose:

Convert LangChain's `Document` format into our API response format.

Mapping:

```text
Document.page_content         -> SourceChunk.content
Document.metadata.source_id   -> SourceChunk.source_id
Document.metadata.filename    -> SourceChunk.filename
Document.metadata.page        -> SourceChunk.page
Document.metadata.chunk_index -> SourceChunk.chunk_index
```

Why we need this:

```text
LangChain Document = internal RAG/library format
SourceChunk        = our frontend/API response format
```

The frontend should not depend on LangChain's internal object shape.

## Step 8: BM25 Keyword Search

File:

```text
backend/app/rag/keyword_store.py
```

Important concept:

BM25 does not use vectors.

It compares the tokenized query against the text chunks stored in ChromaDB.

When we store chunks in ChromaDB, Chroma stores more than vectors:

```text
chunk text
embedding vector
metadata
```

Example stored chunk:

```text
content: "RAG retrieves relevant chunks before answering..."
vector: [0.12, -0.03, ...]
metadata: { filename, page, chunk_index }
```

Vector search uses:

```text
query embedding vs chunk embeddings
```

BM25 uses:

```text
query words vs chunk text words
```

In `bm25_search()`, this line loads stored chunk text and metadata from ChromaDB:

```python
raw = vector_store.get(include=["documents", "metadatas"])
```

That returns something like:

```python
{
    "documents": [
        "RAG retrieves relevant chunks before answering...",
        "Embeddings convert text into vectors...",
        "BM25 is a keyword ranking algorithm..."
    ],
    "metadatas": [
        {"filename": "rag_notes.pdf", "page": 0, "chunk_index": 0},
        {"filename": "rag_notes.pdf", "page": 1, "chunk_index": 1},
        {"filename": "rag_notes.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk_index": 2}
    ]
}
```

BM25 flow:

```text
ChromaDB stored chunk text
  ↓
_load_all_chunks()
  ↓
Tokenize all chunks
  ↓
Build BM25 index in memory
  ↓
Tokenize query
  ↓
Compare query tokens against chunk tokens
  ↓
Return top keyword matches
```

## Step 9: Hybrid Retrieval With RRF

File:

```text
backend/app/rag/retrieval.py
```

Current retrieval flow:

```text
retrieve_final_chunks()
  ↓
hybrid_search()
  ↓
vector_search_mmr()
  +
bm25_search()
  ↓
rrf_fusion()
  ↓
semantic_rerank()
  ↓
final top chunks
```

RRF means Reciprocal Rank Fusion.

We use RRF because vector search and BM25 produce scores that are not directly comparable:

```text
Vector score/distance: 0.18
BM25 score:            12.7
```

RRF does not compare raw scores. It uses rank positions.

Formula:

```text
RRF score = 1 / (RRF_K + rank)
```

With `RRF_K = 60`:

```text
Rank 1 = 1 / 61
Rank 2 = 1 / 62
Rank 3 = 1 / 63
```

If the same chunk appears in both vector search and BM25, its RRF scores are added. This means duplicate chunks are deduplicated but rewarded.

Deduplication happens through:

```python
key = _chunk_key(chunk)
chunks_by_key[key] = chunk
```

Because `chunks_by_key` is a dictionary, only one chunk object is kept per key:

```python
return f"{chunk.source_id}:{chunk.chunk_index}"
```

But RRF score still accumulates:

```python
fused_scores[key] = fused_scores.get(key, 0.0) + (
    1.0 / (RRF_K + rank)
)
```

So a chunk found by both retrievers is:

```text
deduplicated
but rewarded
```

## Step 10: Semantic Reranking

File:

```text
backend/app/rag/rerank.py
```

Purpose:

Semantic reranking takes the RRF-fused candidate chunks and decides which chunks best answer the exact query.

Input:

```text
rewritten standalone query
RRF-fused candidate chunks from hybrid_search()
settings
```

Flow:

```text
RRF candidate chunks
  ↓
semantic_rerank(query, candidates, settings)
  ↓
pair query + each chunk
  ↓
cross-encoder reranker
  ↓
semantic relevance score
  ↓
final top K chunks
```

Important distinction:

```text
RRF = combines retriever rankings
Semantic reranker = judges query + chunk relevance
```

RRF helps the semantic reranker by sending a cleaner, deduplicated, better-ranked candidate pool.

## Step 11: Final LLM Answer Chain

File:

```text
backend/app/rag/chains.py
```

Purpose:

Pass the final retrieved chunks to the LLM and return one answer with sources.

Flow:

```text
answer_question()
  ↓
process_query()
  ↓
retrieve_final_chunks()
  ↓
_format_context()
  ↓
ChatOpenAI
  ↓
ChatResponse
```

The LLM does not receive Python `SourceChunk` objects directly. We convert them to plain text context:

```python
context = _format_context(sources)
```

The context looks like:

```text
[1] rag_notes.pdf, page 2
RAG retrieves relevant chunks before answering...

[2] rag_notes.pdf, page 4
Vector search uses embeddings...
```

The chunks are passed into the LLM here:

```python
f"Retrieved context:\n{context}\n\n"
```

The LLM reads the final chunks and generates one grounded answer. It does not choose only one chunk; it synthesizes a single answer from all useful chunks.

## Future: Frontend Session Scoping

The backend does not currently know whether a browser page was refreshed or whether a new frontend session started.

Right now, tools like Postman are simply making HTTP requests:

```text
Postman
  ↓
POST /api/documents/upload
```

The backend has no browser session concept unless the frontend explicitly sends one.

When we build the frontend, we can define the session lifecycle there:

```text
User opens frontend
  ↓
Frontend generates session_id
  ↓
Upload request sends session_id
Chat request sends session_id
```

One design choice remains:

```text
A. Refresh = new session
   Open -> Session A
   Refresh -> Session B

B. New Chat = new session
   Open -> Session A
   Refresh -> Still Session A
   New Chat -> Session B
```

For a real chat application, option B is usually better because a browser refresh should not normally destroy the user's conversation and uploaded-document context.

For now, we are not modifying the backend for sessions. We will finish and test the RAG pipeline first, then add session isolation when we build the frontend.

## Current Backend Status

```

## Dependencies Installed So Far

### Initial FastAPI Backend Dependencies

Installed when setting up the backend and health endpoint:

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn python-dotenv pydantic-settings
```

What they are for:

```text
fastapi             Python API framework
uvicorn             Runs the FastAPI development server
python-dotenv       Loads .env files
pydantic-settings   Environment-based settings management
```

Recommended command with Uvicorn standard extras:

```bash
pip install fastapi "uvicorn[standard]" python-dotenv pydantic-settings
```

### LangChain Query Processing Dependencies

Installed when creating `query_processing.py`:

```bash
pip install langchain langchain-openai
```

What they are for:

```text
langchain         Core LangChain framework
langchain-openai  LangChain integration for OpenAI chat models and embeddings
```

## Requirements File

We should maintain this file:

```text
backend/requirements.txt
```

Current recommended contents:

```text
fastapi
uvicorn[standard]
python-dotenv
pydantic-settings
python-multipart
openai
langchain
langchain-community
langchain-openai
langchain-chroma
langchain-text-splitters
chromadb
pypdf
rank-bm25
sentence-transformers
```

Why these packages are included:

```text
python-multipart         needed soon for file uploads
openai                   OpenAI SDK dependency
langchain-community      document loaders and BM25 utilities
langchain-chroma         LangChain integration with ChromaDB
langchain-text-splitters document chunking
chromadb                 Chroma Cloud client/vector database

rank-bm25                keyword/BM25 search
sentence-transformers    local cross-encoder semantic reranker
```

Install from requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Dependency sanity check:

```bash
python -c "from fastapi import FastAPI; from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI; print('deps ok')"
```

Expected output:

```text
deps ok
```

## Where LangChain Comes Into The Architecture

LangChain is not the whole backend. It is used inside the RAG modules.

```text
FastAPI              API layer
Our modules          Application architecture
LangChain            LLM/RAG helper framework
ChromaDB             Vector database
OpenAI               LLM + embeddings provider
```

LangChain usage by stage:

```text
Intent detection      ChatOpenAI
Query rewriting       ChatOpenAI
Document loading      LangChain document loaders
Chunking              LangChain text splitters
Embeddings            LangChain OpenAIEmbeddings
Vector search         LangChain Chroma integration against Chroma Cloud
BM25 keyword search   rank-bm25 over ChromaDB stored documents
RRF fusion            our own code in retrieval.py
Semantic reranking    sentence-transformers CrossEncoder
Final answer          ChatOpenAI
```

## Step 12: Document Delete API

We added document deletion to the RAG backend.

Important architecture:

```text
ChromaDB is hosted on Chroma Cloud.
Uploaded files are processed from RAM and are not persisted locally.
Chroma stores the chunks and metadata.
Every chunk from the same uploaded file has the same filename and source_id.
```

### Delete Behavior

Deletion is based on the exact `filename` stored in Chroma metadata.

Example metadata:

```json
{
  "chunk_index": 0,
  "filename": "Amazon_Pharmacy Finance_Saiteja_Senior_Financial_Analyst_Resume copy.pdf",
  "page": 0,
  "source_id": "e2ba7b6ef7054fa5a6d8146b00a0b551"
}
```

The filename must remain exactly as stored:

```text
Preserve spaces
Preserve underscores
Preserve capitalization
Preserve the file extension
Do not normalize or replace spaces
```

### Delete Endpoint

File:

```text
backend/app/main.py
```

Endpoint:

```python
@app.delete("/api/documents/{filename}")
def delete_document(
    filename: str,
    settings: Settings = Depends(get_settings),
):
    delete_indexed_document(
        filename=filename,
        settings=settings,
    )

    return {
        "message": "Document deleted successfully",
        "filename": filename,
    }
```

Conceptual flow:

```text
DELETE /api/documents/{filename}
  ↓
delete_indexed_document(filename, settings)
  ↓
find chunks in Chroma Cloud where metadata.filename == filename
  ↓
delete those chunk IDs from Chroma Cloud
  ↓
return deleted filename
```

Important frontend/API note:

If the filename contains spaces or special characters, the frontend/client must URL-encode it when calling the endpoint.

Example:

```text
Amazon_Pharmacy Finance_Saiteja.pdf
```

should be sent as a URL path-safe value, for example:

```text
Amazon_Pharmacy%20Finance_Saiteja.pdf
```
